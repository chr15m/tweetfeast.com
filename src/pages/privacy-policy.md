## In general

TweetFeast takes your privacy seriously.

## Personal data

TweetFeast does not collect any personal data from you except for your Twitter username, which is already public. We use your Twitter username to provide you with the service of downloading tweets and followers to Excel and other formats.

## Payment processing

To process payments, TweetFeast uses a third-party service called Stripe. Stripe may collect certain information from you such as your name, email address, and billing information. Stripe's use of your personal information is governed by their own privacy policy. See [stripe.com](https://stripe.com) for more details.

## Deletion of data

You may request the deletion of data related to your account at any time by contacting us. Upon request, we will cancel and delete all data associated with your account, including your Twitter username and any data stored related to your account.

## Service providers

TweetFeast may use third-party service providers to provide our service. These service providers are not permitted by law to disclose or use your personal data.

If we use any new service providers in the future, we will update this Privacy Policy to reflect this.
